Dockerfile Commands:

FROM

ENV

WORKDIR

ENTRYPOINT

CMD

COPY

ADD

RUN

EXPOSE


1. FROM

Definition: Specifies the base image to use for creating the Docker image. Example:
Dockerfile

FROM python:3.8-slim

2. WORKDIR

Definition: Sets the working directory inside the Docker container. Example:
Dockerfile

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

3. COPY

Definition: Copies files from the host machine to the Docker container. Example:
Dockerfile

COPY . .

4. RUN

Definition: Executes commands inside the Docker container during the image build process. Example:
Dockerfile

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y libpq-dev

5. CMD

Definition: Specifies the command to run when the Docker container starts. Example:
Dockerfile

CMD ["python", "app.py"]

6. EXPOSE

Definition: Informs Docker that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime. Example:
The EXPOSE command does not actually publish the port. To actually publish the port when running the container, use the -p flagon docker run to publish and map one or more ports.
Dockerfile

EXPOSE 5000

7. ENV

Definition: Sets environment variables. Example:
ENV

ENV <key> <value>

This command used to set the environment variables that is required to run the project.

ENV sets the environment variables, which can be used in the Dockerfile and any scripts that it calls. These are persistent with the container too and they can be referenced at any time.

ENV HTTP_PORT="9000"

Dockerfile

ENV DEBUG True
    (or)
ENV NGINX_VERSION 1.19.0
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y nginx=$NGINX_VERSION

8. ENTRYPOINT

Definition: Configures a container that will run as an executable. Example:
Dockerfile

ENTRYPOINT ["./start.sh"]

9. ARG

Definition: Defines a variable that users can pass at build-time to the builder with the docker build command. Example:
Dockerfile

ARG VERSION=latest
RUN echo "Building version $VERSION"

FROM node:14

# Define build-time argument
ARG NODE_ENV=production

# Use the argument in a RUN command
RUN if [ "$NODE_ENV" = "development" ]; \
    then npm install; \
    else npm install --only=production; \
    fi

Here, ARG NODE_ENV=production sets a default value for NODE_ENV. You can override this value when building the image:
shell

docker build --build-arg NODE_ENV=development -t my-node-app .


10. LABEL

Definition: Adds metadata to an image. Example:
Dockerfile

LABEL version="1.0"

11. VOLUME

Definition: a volume is a persistent storage location that exists outside of the container. Volumes are useful for storing data that needs to persist even if the container is stopped or removed.
Dockerfile

VOLUME ["/data"]

12. MAINTAINER

This statement is a kind of documentation, which defines the author who is creating this Dockerfile or who should you contact if it has bugs.

Example:

MAINTAINER Firstname Lastname <example@geeksforgeeks.com>

13. ADD

The ADD command is used to add one or many local files or folders from the source and adds them to the filesystem of the containers at the destination path.

It is Similar to COPY command but it has some additional features:

    If the source is a local tar archive in a recognized compression format, then it is automatically unpacked as a directory into the Docker image.
    If the source is a URL, then it will download and copy the file into the destination within the Docker image. However, Docker discourages using ADD for this purpose.

ADD rootfs.tar.xz /
ADD http://example.com/big.tar.xz /usr/src/things/

Both CMD and ENTRYPOINT instructions define what command gets executed when running a container. There are a few rules that describe their co-operation.

    Dockerfile should specify at least one of CMD or ENTRYPOINT commands.
    ENTRYPOINT should be defined when using the container as an executable.
    CMD should be used as a way of defining default arguments for an ENTRYPOINT command or for executing an ad-hoc command in a container.
    CMD will be overridden when running the container with alternative arguments.

ENTRYPOINT vs CMD in Dockerfile

Both ENTRYPOINT and CMD define the command that runs when a container starts. Here's when you use each:
ENTRYPOINT

Use ENTRYPOINT to specify a command that will not be overridden by docker run command line arguments. It's ideal for setting up the primary command for your container. Example:
Dockerfile

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]

This ensures app.py always runs when the container starts.
CMD

Use CMD to provide default arguments for the ENTRYPOINT command or to specify a command that can be overridden. Example:
Dockerfile

CMD ["--help"]

If paired with ENTRYPOINT, CMD provides arguments:
Dockerfile

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]
CMD ["--debug"]

This runs python app.py --debug, but you can override --debug when you run the container:
shell

docker run my-image --production

Combining ENTRYPOINT and CMD

Best used together when you need a default command with optional arguments:
Dockerfile

ENTRYPOINT ["python", "app.py"]
CMD ["--default-option"]

When to use which:

    ENTRYPOINT: When you need a specific command that users should not change.

    CMD: When you need default arguments for the ENTRYPOINT or a default command that users can override.

Hope this clears it up! Let me know if there’s more you’re curious about.

there is only cmd and no rum instruction in dockerfile what happen
Copilot

If you only have a CMD instruction and no ENTRYPOINT in a Dockerfile, CMD provides the command that will run when a container is started. If you run the container without specifying a different command, Docker defaults to the CMD instruction.
Example:
Dockerfile

FROM ubuntu:latest
CMD ["echo", "Hello, World!"]

When this container starts, it will execute echo "Hello, World!" by default. However, if you override it when running the container, like this:
shell

docker run my-image cat /etc/os-release

It will run cat /etc/os-release instead of echo "Hello, World!".

In essence, CMD is a default instruction, easily overridden. If the command provided by CMD is meant to be the primary function of the container, ENTRYPOINT would be more appropriate. Any specific case you have in mind for a Dockerfile?

Example 1: Basic Web App
Dockerfile

FROM nginx:latest

ENV NGINX_PORT=80

WORKDIR /usr/share/nginx/html

ENV FLASK_RUN_HOST=0.0.0.0

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

Docker Compose YAML File Structure

A Docker Compose YAML file allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications. Here's a detailed breakdown of its structure:
1. Version

Defines the version of the Compose file format.
yaml

version: '3.8'

Different versions support different features. Always choose the version compatible with your Docker Engine.
2. Services

Specifies the containers to run. Each service is like a single container configuration.
yaml

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
  database:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example

3. Service Configuration Options

image: Specifies the Docker image to use.
yaml

image: nginx:latest

build: Defines build instructions for creating an image.
yaml

build:
  context: ./path/to/build
  dockerfile: Dockerfile

ports: Exposes and maps ports.
yaml

ports:
  - "8080:80"

volumes: Mounts host paths or volumes.
yaml

volumes:
  - /host/path:/container/path

environment: Sets environment variables.
yaml

environment:
  - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=example

depends_on: Specifies dependencies.
yaml

depends_on:
  - database

4. Networks

Defines networks for communication between services.
yaml

networks:
  my-network:

5. Volumes

Defines named volumes for persistent storage.
yaml

volumes:
  my-volume:

Full Example
yaml

version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    image: nginx:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./html:/usr/share/nginx/html
    environment:
      - NGINX_PORT=80
    depends_on:
      - database

  database:
    image: mysql:5.7
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=example
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  db-data:

networks:
  my-network:

In this example:

    web service uses the nginx image, maps port 8080 to 80, mounts a volume, sets an environment variable, and depends on the database service.

    database service uses the mysql image, sets an environment variable, and mounts a volume for data persistence.

    volumes defines a named volume db-data.

    networks defines a custom network my-network.
    
    
 version: '3.8'

services:
  myapp:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: my_custom_container_name
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./app:/usr/src/app
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    command: node server.js
